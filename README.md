# traffic-light-with-pedestrian-crossing
This project was for a microcontroller course laboratory. The purpose was to simulate an intersection of a primary and secondary road. 
Every road has four tracks, of which two are SOLOS. Each road has a pedestrian button that turns that road traffic light to red and the 
other one can only go forward, the solo is not activated until the pedestrian crosses. 

In the repository, we can find the Arduino code and some pictures of the circuit scheme, the implemented circuit, and the problem as a draw.
